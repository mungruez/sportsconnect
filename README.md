The home page shows all the players, use the nav bar to create a new player. Once a new player is created you will
        be able to view,edit or delete that player from the Players table. Click the 
        "Events" button to see the list of all events that Players have created. On the Events screen
        enter a players ID number to add, update or delete events. The Join and Leave buttons only become
        visible if a Player's id is entered and only owners are allowed to edit owned Events. These features
        make this an awesome start to becoming monolithic.
